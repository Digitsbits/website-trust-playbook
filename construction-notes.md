# Construction Website Trust Notes

Construction websites lose trust quickly when credibility cannot be verified within the first few seconds.

## Common trust leaks
- Unclear service area or location
- Generic stock photos instead of real projects
- No visible licensing or insurance information
- No project gallery or low-quality images
- Missing company background or owner details
- Weak headline that doesn’t explain specialization

## What improves trust fast
- Clear statement of what you build and where you work
- Real project photos near the top of the page
- Proof blocks: license, insurance, years in business
- Reviews from real clients
- Simple and clear quote or contact process

## Suggested homepage order
1. Headline: service + location
2. Proof row (license, insurance, experience)
3. Project gallery
4. Services
5. Process
6. Testimonials
7. Contact or quote form
