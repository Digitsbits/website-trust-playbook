# Website Trust Playbook

A practical playbook for why many small business websites look fine but lose trust fast — often before the first scroll.
This repository focuses on structure, clarity, and trust signals that help visitors decide quickly.

## What this covers

- First-impression issues (headline, hierarchy, layout)
- Trust signals (social proof, credentials, reviews, photos)
- Clarity problems (what you do, who you serve, where you work)
- Common UX mistakes that create doubt
- Industry notes (construction, service businesses, local companies)

## Quick principles

1. Make the “what you do” obvious in 3 seconds.
2. Reduce uncertainty with proof (reviews, projects, credentials).
3. Use clear structure: headline → proof → services → process → contact.
4. Show real work and real people (authentic photos beat stock).
5. Make key info easy to find: location, phone, hours, license, insurance.
